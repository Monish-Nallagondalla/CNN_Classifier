# Chicken Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on building an end-to-end system for classifying chicken diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to distinguish between healthy chickens and those affected by *Coccidiosis* based on fecal images. The project includes deployment and testing workflows on AWS and Azure for practical usability.

## üìÇ Project Overview

Chicken diseases, especially *Coccidiosis*, are a significant challenge in poultry farming. Early and accurate detection is crucial to minimizing losses. This project leverages deep learning to automate the classification process, offering a scalable solution for poultry health management.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN-based classifier trained on chicken fecal images.
- **End-to-End System**: Includes model training, evaluation, deployment, and testing workflows.
- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Integrated deployment pipelines for AWS and Azure.
- **DVC Integration**: Tracks data and model versioning efficiently.
